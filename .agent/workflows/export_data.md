1. Run the export script to generate CSV files from JS data:
   `node tools/data_sync/export_to_sheet.mjs`

2. (Optional) Provide instructions to upload the CSV content:
   `echo "✅ Export complete. Please check the 'exports/' folder (or root folder) for updated CSV files and upload them to Google Sheets."`
